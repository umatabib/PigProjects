Apache Pig:
------------------
Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs.
Pig interprets Pig Latin code to create MapReduce jobs
Pig is a procedural data flow language -pig latin.
Grunt shell is used to write pig commands.
Pig has 2 modes: Local mode and MapReduce mode
Pig can be used to analyse any type of data.

Scaling in production: How to handle for millions of records?
----------------
This application can easily be scaled for huge data as Apache Pig runs on top of Apache Hadoop's map reduce framework.

A hadoop framework application works in an environment that provides distributed storage and computation across clusters of computers.

Hence, just by adding more number of data nodes in HDFS, this application would be ready to handle large amount of data. 

Features of HDFS such as fault tolerence, scalability,minimal data motion can be leveraged.

Note: I have tested these scripts in 'local' as well as 'mapreduce' mode provided by Apache Pig.
I was able to use 1 node cluster due to limitation of Cloudera's Quick Start VM.
In production we can have multiple nodes to handle much larger data.
